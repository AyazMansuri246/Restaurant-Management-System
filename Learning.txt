Learning's from the Restaurant Management Project

1. break and continue that is jump statement cant be applied in forEach loop and hence use for of, for loop etc.
2. The forEach loop does not handle asynchronous code properly because it doesn't wait for the await inside. 
Instead, use a for...of loop or Promise.all to manage asynchronous operations correctly.
